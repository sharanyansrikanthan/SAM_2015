init.c: Initializes SAM 
Usage: ./init <PID>
Example: ./init 1000

PID specified with init is to restrict SAM from operating on some threads.
SAM will not move/control tasks whose PID is less than the specified PID. 
Value of 1000 prevents SAM from moving special purpose threads spawned 
when Linux is launched on the machine it was developed. 

A good value can be obtained by typing "ps" in the shell after Linux boots. 

deploy.c: Activates SAM scheduling
Usage: ./deploy <scheduling interval in milliseconds>
Example: sudo ./deploy 100 

100ms interval works well and is discussed in the paper

HuBench.c: Microbenchmark to create coherence traffic
Creates a 4 threaded microbenchmark to create coherence traffic. 
There are 2 pairs of threads, each pair that communicates with its
paired thread. Linux by default schedules them on different sockets
creating coherence traffic. Used to determine SAM thresholds as discussed
in the paper.
