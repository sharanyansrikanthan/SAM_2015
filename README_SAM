For the usual compilation and installation instructions, refer to the README.

This file talks about the specific parameters needed to be initialized for SAM.
These parameters are obtained by offline characterization of the underlying hardware platform.

All these parameters are present in kernel/sched/core.h
Details on these parameters is explained in this file. Information on setting
thresholds is explained in the paper: 
Sharanyan Srikanthan, Sandhya Dwarkadas, and Kai Shen, "Data Sharing or Resource Contention: Toward Performance Transparency on Multicore Systems", In Proc. of the USENIX Annual Technical Conference, Santa Clara, CA, July 2015

These are following are architecture specific MSRs. They do not have to changed for
IvyBridge, SandyBridge, Haswell, Broadwell, etc. Please do refer to the architectural manual for any future changes. 
#define IA32_FIXED_CTR_CTRL 0x38D
#define IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL 0x38F
#define PERF_FIXED_CTR0 0x309
#define PERF_FIXED_CTR1 0x30A
#define PERF_FIXED_CTR2 0x30B
#define PerfEvtSel0 0x186
#define PerfEvtSel1 0x187
#define PerfEvtSel2 0x188
#define PerfEvtSel3 0x189
#define IA32_PMC0 0xC1
#define IA32_PMC1 0xC2
#define IA32_PMC2 0xC3
#define IA32_PMC3 0xC4
#define OFFCORE_RSP_0 0x1A6

The following are machine dependent parameters that are to be set for every machine:
#define MAX_SHAR_NUM_SOCKETS 2 // The number of sockets
#define MAX_SHAR_PROCESSORS_CORE 20 // Number of logical cores in a socket           
int SHAR_MEM_THRESH = 75000000;   // LLC_MISSES threshold as described in the paper
int SHAR_COHERENCE_THRESH = 550000; // Inter-socket coherence activity threshold as described in paper
#define SHAR_REMOTE_THRESH 2700000  // Similar threshold for remote memory accesses 
#define SHAR_CYCLES 2200000000.0    // Number of cycles max CPU cycles in a second

The above values can be changed dynamically, if required, to control the experiments as needed.
